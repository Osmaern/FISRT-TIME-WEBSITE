        Lord I'm amazed I no fit describe my feelings
        Gave me all the love when I needed you
        Ɔhene mese what more could I ask for?
        There's a way that you make me feel
        I'll be lying if I say I'm not patient enough
        Tell me what more could I ask for?
       <br>
        Blessings flow like a river
        Freezing cold in Madina
        Neverland, Peter
        Bɔ me nsenku oo na m'agyigya
        Took some potion bi na ama m'asesa
        Might be hosting a dinner
        Sea food akrante Jollof and gizzard
        Vegetarians yɛbɛyɛ mo stir fry
        Veges of course no calamari
        <br>

        Son of the Sun I'm never unlucky

        So my sherri l coco why worry why worry
        <br>
